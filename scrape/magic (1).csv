The older mentor Jedi walks the hero through a desert planet opening,finds Han Solo and Chewbacca, gets cut down by the Sith while X-Wings fight Tie Fighters, a giant planet destroyer is itself destroyed and the forces of good are saved.; If you're thinking of A New Hope, The Force Awakens (or minus the the specifics of Han Solo, X-Wings and the planet destroying weapon replaced by another weapon) you would be right, but what I find most disappointing is that J.J Abrams, who is not known for avoiding innovation, basically remade the old Star Wars formula. I see no Star Wars revolution replacing the known and loved young protagonists of A New Hope with new characters while the roles of the older mentors are now the cast of the 1977 title.; I will give the film credit for a few fan pleasing moments. I found Rey a very fun character and felt she acted well. Seeing Han Solo being himself for a few minutes was great, as was watching the Millennium Falcon fly again. I was positively surprised when Keylo Ren actually took off his mask and seeing the downed Star Destroyer in the sand was visually impressive. However, these few tidbits were too few and far between in a story that was as lacking in uniqueness as most of the new characters in it.; It is our collective loss that an innovator like J.J. Abrams basically redid A New Hope to a T, from the familiar opening of a droid wandering the desert and anti climactic ending with an X-Wing Tie Fighter battle less exciting than the original. I understand that there is a fear to try something new when there is a formula that is proved to work but the Star Wars galaxy far far away is a huge place, and I personally would rather a director take a risk and show us the characters we love doing new things. Watching this movie I felt that I'd seen it all before and if I knew that I'd be watching A New Hope again I would not have hurried to watch it opening night knowing that I'd already seen it 38 years ago.","Was the above review useful to you?"

The movie overall is barely above The Phantom Menace. It has all the basic ingredients from the OT but sadly most are reduced to barely glimpsed cameos.; Han & Chewie carry the movie. Without them it would be in deep trouble. Rey is OK but the rest of the newcomers leave little impression apart from BB8 (who is not even human just a droid).; The new actors are all miscast (except for Daisy Ridley) & or the screenplay is weak so is the plot.; The movie barely works at all its confusing a lot of the time & very unconvincing the way the drama plays out is pretty amateurish.; John Williams is wasted his music is not very memorable at all. Big letdown.; ILM FX are also very average nothing special just stuff you have seen in other Star Wars movies.; George Lucas is lucky & wise he retired after 6 movies to let others take the criticism's. TFA deserves a lot of negativity mainly towards the story,screenplay, plot, direction & producers. Its a barely functional Star Wars movie which plays more like a mismatch of the OT SW movies than a new entry.; At best its A New Hope redux with barely different characters/locations.; At worse its a film school fanboy A New Hope redux.; My only hope is EP8 is way better otherwise Star Wars as a viable film franchise is finished creatively.","Was the above review useful to you?"

Fans show up and we're served molded cow *beep* on a plate sprinkled with cheddar cheese, a smoking bucket of mongrel stomach bile and a small wine glass filled with entrails of an ostrich with a cocktail stick jabbed through a tiny tarantula eye.; Fans roared in disgust while J.J Abrams looked at us in stupidity. ""What? You don't like your molded cow *beep*? What is wrong with you fans?""; You know what some people say, J.J Abrams, right? Gag me with a *beep* spoon.; And so the Star Wars meal was absolute rubbish. You lied to us, J.J Abrams. You're a big fat liar. You ruined Star Wars and all hope it had.

Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations.","Was the above review useful to you?"

JJ's universe looks and feels gorgeous but some of the depth and epicness of the originals was lost in the process. Although the film offers exhilarating action and a very fast pace, with little time to give viewers a better understanding of whats going on across the galaxy (giving very little of what the prequels maybe gave us too much). Humor is very present, and jokes work well for most of the film, but more then once, silly quotes ruin some dramatic moments and ultimately, ruin a little bit of the epicness and gravity of some moments. The range of emotions you can get with this film however is very wide, from nostalgia to pain, from anxiety to comfort. JJ learned with the prequel's mistakes. The plot is light, uncomplicated and straightforward. It will be a huge hit with kids and people who are not very familiar with Star Wars, while the crazy amount of fan service will also please the old school fans. If you don't go to the cinema with extremely high expectations, you might even surprise yourself. It is not best Star Wars movie ever, but it's a hell lot of fun.; Enjoy!","Was the above review useful to you?"

After all, it's been 30 years since Return of the Jedi. It's nostalgia overload and there are surprises to be found in almost every scene. It's a thrilling beginning, and ticks a lot of fan-pleasing boxes that perhaps won't be so exploited (for lack of a better word) in future episodes. There are myriad flaws, from some rather woeful dialogue to an overload of slapstick comedy. Don't get me wrong, it's genuinely funny, but sometimes the humour comes at the expense of more serious scenes, and totally kills them in the process, for instance when Kylo Ren is in a rage and a couple of Stormtroopers are walking in his direction, only for them to suddenly turn around and briskly march the other way. It vanquished Ren's menace in a heartbeat.; I don't think this film takes itself seriously enough, so the darker aspects don't work as well as they should - at least compared to the saga's previous instalments - and so the level of threat doesn't feel that significant. Starkiller Base is introduced too late in the story and really doesn't feature a whole lot. It kind of comes and goes. Once Finn and Rey are established the film almost rushes to the end at a break-neck pace.; Speaking of Finn and Rey, where did they learn to use a lightsaber? Didn't Luke have to train to use one? Rey's very sudden knowledge of the Force is altogether unconvincing. I don't think it's ever been established that being Force-sensitive gives you the sudden ability to be capable of using one to give a Sith-Lord-in-the-making a run for his money in a duel. Obviously you can't have Star Wars without lightsaber battles, but it felt a bit forced, no pun intended. I would have appreciated some explanation to how Finn was so adept given he showed no signs of being Force-sensitive. I'd also like to know the same for Leia since it was hinted in Return of the Jedi that she in fact is.; Kylo Ren should never have removed his mask when interrogating Rey. His face should've been seen for the first time when he unmasks for Han Solo. I'd also have preferred an actor who actually looked remotely intimidating beneath the mask.; I'm touching on the negatives just to express what I felt were the downfalls of an otherwise spectacular movie that I greatly enjoyed. This is an excellent set-up for things to come.","Was the above review useful to you?"

Well, thanks J.J. Abrams for ruining my night; you owe me four hours sleep.; To avoid spoilers I will do my best to keep this vague but to the point. The overall view is this: the new characters are weak and mostly unexplained, the interactions between new and old characters feels disingenuous, decent story development has been traded for cheap nostalgia, the whole film is rushed and if you have seen Episode IV then you have seen at least 50% of this film. No kidding, I am going to watch Episode IV closely to see if they have actually copied and pasted.; The new characters: Finn is dull and Rey is conveniently good at EVERYTHING. The introduction of each is rushed, as is the relationship they develop with each other and with the old characters throughout the film, all of which ends up feeling completely disingenuous. We know absolutely nothing about them (maybe the next film will explain?) which makes it incredibly hard to feel anything for either of them.; Cheap Nostalgia: I have no issue with a bit of cheesy nostalgia, but lets not base an entire film on it and forget to write a story. O wait, why write a story when we could just use Episode IV's? Silly me. The introduction of Leia, Han, Chewie and C-3PO is forced. Once the initial ""wahoo"" moment of seeing your favourites has passed, do they really add anything to the film? No, they don't.; Rushed: Really rushed. Huge parts of the characters background are skipped, the last thirty years are a blur, I still have absolutely no idea who the ""baddies"" are or where they come from and the ""epic"" battle is so rushed that it is, well to be honest, s*#t.; Story and character development, with particular reference being made to the relationships between old and new characters, is virtually non-existent. Everybody just happens to love everyone else immediately and with no reason. And Rey, our new, strong, female protagonist, is conveniently amazing at everything she does instantly without any reasoning as to why. But then given that the story is so poor, without this convenience there would be nothing left.; To top it off, this film IS Episode IV. Entire scenes are almost identical. With Episode I, II and III, at least the writers had the excuse of being bound to a set story that all fans knew inside and out. But with Episode VII the possibilities were almost endless. There is no excuse for recycling the old films.; J.J. Abrams has played it so safe with this film that I would feel comfortable leaving a small, indefensible baby alone with it for a prolonged period of time.","Was the above review useful to you?"

However there is a true lack of Originality.; My first issue is that since Lucas has sold the rights to this, you can see this is a typical Disney style film. By selling out this franchise he has sacrificed a cult classic. The Villain Ren for example, has no evil appeal. He is a soft character and reminds me of a typical Harry Potter style Villain. When you look at characters such as Darth Vader and Darth Maul, this new guy is just weird teenager geek type character reminding me of the villain in KickAss, Red Mist.; Secondly Disney is clearly aiming this movie at a younger generation age range 8-15. They are also more concerned with profits than widening the appeal to the masses.; Thirdly they used a safe bet storyline rather than using any originality, they have used similar ideas concepts used in the Original Empire strikes back movie.; I personally think the Prequels are quite good in comparison to this new generation Star Wars. Especially because I liked the Prequels Originality and new story lines, as well as a wider understanding of new planets in the wider galactic empire.; With Force Awakens, be prepared to not feel the same surprise factors felt in all the previous Star Wars movies.; On a more positive note, I like that a lot of the Original cast has made a comeback to recreate the epic that was created many decades ago. Apart from that, I hope Lucas found all that extra money worth it because Disney has robbed you man.","Was the above review useful to you?"
